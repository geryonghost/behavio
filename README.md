# Behavio

# Purpose
My wife works in a classroom with special needs children. We were trying to assess whether or not the weather had any impact on their behavior. This project was initially created to manually track their behavior as it relates to the day of the week, lunar cycle, and barometric pressure.

If you would like to continue the work, feel free to continue working with our limited code.

## Struggles
- We have limited input to create valuable models.

## Help
We would like to move this project forward, but need help being able to use AI to scrape websites efficiently and cost effectively.
